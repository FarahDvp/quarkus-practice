# quarkus-practice
This project demonstrates various capabilities of Quarkus, a supersonic subatomic Java framework.

## Key Features:

- REST Client: Learn how to use Quarkus' REST Client for making RESTful API calls.
- Fault Tolerance: Implement fault tolerance with annotations such as @Retry, @Fallback, and @CircuitBreaker to ensure reliability in distributed systems.
- Persistence with Hibernate Panache: Use Hibernate Panache for simplifying database interactions and reducing boilerplate code.
- Docker and JIB: Build and containerize your application using Docker or JIB.
- Health Checks: Integrate health checks to monitor your application's status and ensure availability.
- Kubernetes Deployment: Deploy your Quarkus application to a Kubernetes environment for seamless scaling and orchestration.
- OpenID Connect with Keycloak: Implement secure authentication and authorization with Keycloak using OpenID Connect.
- Rest Assured: Use Rest Assured for testing and validating your RESTful API endpoints.
- Mockito for Mocking: Write unit tests using Mockito to mock dependencies and ensure proper testing.
- Templating with Qute: Utilize Qute, the templating engine for building dynamic web pages.
- Metrics: Integrate application metrics for monitoring performance and health.
- JBang for Quarkus: Use JBang for running Quarkus applications with minimal configuration.
- Kafka Integration: Leverage Apache Kafka for distributed messaging and event-driven architecture.


This project provides a hands-on guide to understanding the power and versatility of Quarkus for building modern, scalable Java applications.
